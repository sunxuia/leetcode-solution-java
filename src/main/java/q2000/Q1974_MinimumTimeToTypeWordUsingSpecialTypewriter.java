/**
 * [Easy] 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-type-word-using-special-typewriter/
 *
 * There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' arranged in a circle with a pointer. A
 * character can only be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the
 * character 'a'.
 * (å›¾Q1974_PIC.jpg)
 * Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:
 *
 * - Move the pointer one character counterclockwise or clockwise.
 * - Type the character the pointer is currently on.
 *
 * Given a string word, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters in word.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: word = "abc"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * The characters are printed as follows:
 * - Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
 * - Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
 * - Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
 * - Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
 * - Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: word = "bza"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * The characters are printed as follows:
 * - Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
 * - Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
 * - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
 * - Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
 * - Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
 * - Type the character 'a' in 1 second.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: word = "zjpc"
 * Output: 34
 * Explanation:
 * The characters are printed as follows:
 * - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
 * - Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
 * - Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
 * - Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
 * - Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
 * - Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
 * - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
 * - Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= word.length <= 100
 * word consists of lowercase English letters.
